These are TV series that are (mostly) spread across multiple seasons of varying lengths, made up of multiple episodes that each contain multiple scenes.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Season lengths and continuity: How TV shows have changed.</p>\n<p>Back in my youth, when I was cutting my teeth on episodes of Star Trek: The Next Generation, TV was made in a very different way to how it is done these days. Season were roughly 20 to 26 episodes long, and written in a way where you could jump in at any episode and pick up what was going on. The status quo of the characters and overall situation of the shows fiction was at roughly the same place at the end of the episode as it was at the start. This allowed networks to show episodes in any order, and it was assumed viewers would be more likely to start watching somewhere in the middle - which was important since it was expensive to own a whole season on VHS to watch.</p>\n<p>Now, with the advent of DVD, Bluray, digital distribution, and streaming services, it&rsquo;s much easier to watch a shows season beginning to end - often all at once if you&rsquo;re a binge watcher like me. As such, seasons tend to be much shorter, with less &lsquo;filler&rsquo; episodes, and with a much more volatile status quo. Characters die, and the situation around them changes dramatically. The seasons are tighter, more contiguous experiences.</p>\n<p>I bring this up to define what Impulse Drive means when it uses the word Season. In terms of the game, it is much more flexible than even the modern definition. A Season may be as short as a few sessions, since it is used to express a series of events happening over a longer period of time. When the situation that surrounds the Crew changes dramatically, and you have to reorder your notes, you&rsquo;re looking at the end of one season and the beginning of another.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>As such, it helps to have tools at your disposal that help you organize your thoughts and ideas, and help you control the pace or cadence of events in your game. For this purpose, you have Strains. Strains are a way of describing the pressures that you apply to the Crew Members and their environment. Use Strains to organize your thoughts and notes about your game, and to add urgency or structure to the game as you play it. Use Strains when they make sense, or when they enhance your game. If using a Strain for a particular occasion feels restrictive or cumbersome, don&rsquo;t force it, let play happen naturally.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>As an Improvisation-heavy Space Master who is familiar with the inspiring fiction and its tropes for Impulse Drive, I have a very light touch with Strains, but this isn&rsquo;t the norm for all, or many people who are familiar with running roleplaying games as Dungeon Masters, Game Masters, Masters of Ceremonies, Hollyhock Gods or any other number of similar roles. Your usage of Strains is a dial. Use them as much or as little as helps you as a GM and your style. If you are a new GM, you may use them a lot more to give yourself more structure during play, and to feel more prepared.</p>\n<p>Remember that Strains are a tool to help you find out what happens in play, not how you organize plots you wish to guide your players through. Each Strain you create and use does not have to be complete. Leave blanks! Fill in what you need, or what you have, and play to find out if anything fills in the blank sections.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>@JournalEntry[Components of your Strains]</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>@JournalEntry[Types of Strains]</p>"}
